		<h2>About Deadpool(Me)</h2>
		<p>So you've probably heard everything under the sun about me. Some people believe I'm a hero because I've been part of some of the most legendary teams in the world like Mercs for Money, X-Men, and most notably X-force, but I continue to disagree. I'm Canadian, my favorite food is chimichanga (but im sure you knew that already), and I'm funny(we knew that too).</p>

		<h2>Friends</h2>
		<p>You know I've always wanted to be Spiderman's friend but we all know he's too hollywood now. I count Daredevil as one of my friends, even though hes serious 98% of the time. There's one person, though, who I admire and consider one of my closest friends and thats the legend himself: Captain America. Below I've plugged some of their pages. Let them know I sent you!</p>
